If found:  **Inner loop**:  * Delete the identified analysis.  * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value.
